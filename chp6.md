# Week - 6 python

* we hope you have a ability to learn new language

* use scratch to mimic the program

# python

* no more semicolomn
* no more standio
* no more type of variable
* do the same thing but very simple
* f-strnig

# compiler

 `python hello_world.py`
source code -> your functionality

# implementation

* super easy. no need to free memory. powerful loop

* same program

# python features vs C features

* paid price, python is slower 1.45s vs 0.5s
* if you're doing your homework. you don't care!
* if you are searching million of people. if will take you more server for cost. you shoud use C!
* `src6` C code vs python code 
* is any thing in c could be done in python? - no, some language are build or better suited for certain domain.
* for example, if you want to using C to build a web service you will be exhausted, but in python, ruby, Java, there are a lot of features to help you.
* the fact is like language like python doesn't have pointer, because it is so easy to make a mistake of pointer

* no need to write a main funtion in python. you just start writing your code.
* in python, no portotype, use a module instead.
* Pythonic code - simple, but maybe the best idea to maintain.
* there are no `++` operator in python
* there are no `do while` syntax in python
* default python using positional arguments and keyword arguments, C use positional arguments only
* be carful about default argument

* input will always return `string`
* overflow? - there is no upper bound in python numbers, some other guy deal with the problem
* list - no more `malloc` and `realloc`
* `for in` in Iterable
* `argv` in `sys` -> `from sys import argv`
* `exit` in `sys`
* `if ... in` means a loop $O(N)$
  + what is the time and space complexity in python syntax sugar? - you can read python documentation
* `dictionary` - string abstraction with hash table 
* `if ... in iterable` - worked in a dictionary.
* double quote ans single quote are the same, can be use for both. in C, double for string, sinlge for char
* python do strnig compare using `==` , C do that using `strcmp`
* swap two values

`x, y = y, x` , in C, you need `*a, *b, tmp`

# Regular expression

* there is a feature C do not have, but in Python, Bash, Java, ... there is!

# AI

* using Google speech API and Google face API!
* face recogntion
* QR code - straight-forward loading link by QR Code!
